#### Work reports and descriptions
* April 16, 2020: The prototype by Arduino ( the Code and the simulation ) done and based the article/work of James P. Lynch "Adafruit Menta ECG Simulator". There is a problem with the simulation, the voltage output from the circuit was in Volt, not Millivolt. The next work is to test it in real, __I will back to this work when I have a real oscilloscope__. If the work is done by Arduino, I will transfer it to work with ESP8266 or ESP32, I will low the cost from 60$ to just 10 $.
